{"name":"RoverMUD","tagline":"Python, Object Oriented, Modular MUD","body":"RoverMUD\r\n========\r\n\r\nA modular, object oriented, python based MUD.\r\n\r\nNotable Features\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n### Attachments\r\n\"Attachments\" allow perception and action.\r\n\r\nFor example, the player has \"player legs\" attached to their character. The legs register their commands (\"west\", \"east\", \"north\", etc.,) with the character's interpreter.\r\n\r\nLikewise, \"player eyes\" register their \"look\" command with the character's interpreter. When another character enters the room, this action emits a visual stimulation targetted to all objects in the room; any player or non-player character with attached eyes will have that stimulation interpretted for them.\r\n\r\nThis system of attachments was designed to accomodate non-player characters. A set of \"non-player eyes\" would deliver visual stimulation to the character in a more uninterpretted, code-like form, suitable for interpretation by artificial intelligence routines.\r\n\r\n### Universe\r\nA \"universe\" is an isolated gameplay state with its own mechanics. There is presently a \"login\" universe in which the player creates a character or logs in, and a \"simple\" universe which will be included in the development and release versions of this project. A character is created in the login universe when the player initiates a connection and then translated into a simple-universe character and placed in the \"simple\" universe when they complete login. In principle, there could be multiple, isolated play-universes or multiple, connected universes with methods to translate characters and events from one into the other.\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a well documented and architectured MUD that demonstrates the capability and methodology of the codebase. This project will not produce a fully-featured, production MUD. I would happily connect developers who are interested in working together on such a project, or help manage pull requests for such a project.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAnyone interested in helping the codebase move to sqlite may contact me. Due to the modularity of universes, I'm placing some unique requirements on the database system.\r\n\r\nOnce I have completed some refactoring the project will be able to more flexibly integrate contributions.\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nFor more information, read notes.md.\r\n\r\nRequires\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* python 2.7+ (2.6+?)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python mud_main.py\r\n```\r\n    \r\nYou may then telnet to the server on port 7777. Recommend running RoverMUD server within a 'screen' session.\r\n\r\nType 'help' after logging in to see available commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\n\r\nThough the basic functions of a MUD are functional, I would consider the code 'unstable' until the items in the 'immediate to-do' have been completed. Any fork made at this point will not be compatible architecturally with the first release version.\r\n\r\n### What Works\r\n\r\n* Scheduling\r\n* Creating a character\r\n* Logging in\r\n* Moving around\r\n* Taking and dropping objects\r\n* Looking at things\r\n* Hitting and killing things\r\n* All commands in 'help'\r\n\r\n### Immediate To-Do\r\n\r\n* Merge character and mob\r\n* Bring the attachment system to spec\r\n* Move from pickle to sqlite for storage\r\n\r\n### Later To-Do\r\n\r\n* OLC\r\n* Experience and leveling\r\n* Wearing and wielding\r\n* A larger world\r\n* NPC AI examples\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nApache License v2\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Joseph Schilz, Joseph@Schilz.org\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
